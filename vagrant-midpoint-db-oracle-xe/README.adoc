= Oracle XE for midPoint

Before running `vagrant up` first create `tmp` directory for non-provided files.
Two RPMs and two SQL files must be placed in `tmp` directory.

From https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/xe-downloads.html download the following:

* oracle-database-xe-18c*.rpm
* oracle-database-preinstall-18c*.rpm

From midpoint sources (repository):

* https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Evolveum/midpoint/master/config/sql/oracle-4.2-all.sql
* https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Evolveum/midpoint/master/repo/repo-sql-impl-test/sql-procedures/oracle.sql

When you have these in the `tmp` directory, run:
----
vagrant up
----

And wait... if everything is OK, you can try:
----
vagrant ssh
----

== How to use

JDBC URL is (`/` before service name is important, it's not SID!):
`jdbc:oracle:thin:@//192.168.56.31:1521/XEPDB1`

Username/password: `midpoint`/`password`

Midpoint doesn't have its own database, but it has its own schema/user `MIDPOINT`.

Properties file for tests is provided, see comment there how to use it.
