= Linux for midPoint build

This environment provides Linux machine (Ubuntu) with Zulu JDK 11 (other versions are possible)
and Maven, git and other tools for midPoint build.

To run the environment (first time takes longer):
----
vagrant up
----

And wait... if everything is OK, you can try:
----
vagrant ssh
----

== How to use

After connecting to the machine (e.g. with `vagrant ssh`) the default `JAVA_HOME` is ready.
Midpoint must be cloned from the repository first, HTTPS is used, so GitHub account is not needed.
After that midPoint can be built (first build takes longer to download many dependencies) and run:

----
# we create non-default directory, because ~/midpoint is also default midpoint.home
git clone https://github.com/Evolveum/midpoint.git midpoint-src
cd midpoint-src
mvn clean install -DskipTests -P -dist
java -jar gui/admin-gui/target/midpoint-executable.war &
----

Started midPoint will create its home directory in ~/midpoint.
