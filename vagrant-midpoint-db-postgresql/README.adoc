= PostgreSQL for midPoint

Necessary SQL schema files from midpoint sources (repository) are downloaded by Vagrantfile.
If a different version is necessary, modify the `Vagrantfile` accordingly.

To run the environment (first time takes longer):

----
vagrant up
----

And wait... if everything is OK, you can try:

----
vagrant ssh
----

== How to use

JDBC URL is: `jdbc:postgresql://192.168.56.30:5432/midpoint`

Username/password: `midpoint`/`password`

IP must match the one from the link:Vagrantfile[].

Properties file `vagrant-postgresql.properties` for tests is provided, see comment there how to use it.

Just copy provided `config.xml` (not used by the Vagrant box, actually) to your `${midpoint.home}`.
Alternatively, create a new directory like `midpoint-home-postgresql`, put the `config.xml` there
and run the midpoint with this JVM argument: `-Dmidpoint.home=<path-to>\midpoint-home-posgresql`.
