= midPoint support Vagrant boxes

https://www.vagrantup.com/[Vagrant] is an easy way how to prepare virtual machines quickly,
especially for development or testing purposes.

On Windows, I recommend https://chocolatey.org/[Chocolatey package manager] to install both
https://www.virtualbox.org/[VirtualBox] and Vagrant quickly.

After https://chocolatey.org/install[installing Chocolatey],
it's a matter of two commands in `cmd` (run as administrator, of course):
----
cinst -y virtualbox
cinst -y vagrant
----

After that just enter the provided subdirectories, check README file for necessary steps and then run:
----
vagrant up
----

And the magic happens...
